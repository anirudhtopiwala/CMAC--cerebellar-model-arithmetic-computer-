# CMAC (cerebellar model arithmetic computer)

I have trained the neural network to follow a 1D function of cosine (x). Initially discrete inputs were given and then continuous inputs were also experimented with.
A total of 35 weights have been taken with input space evenly divided in 100 points. Out of these 70 points were used in training and the rest 30 in testing.
To run the program, first run the train.m file and then test.m file to see the results. Also play with the input function to see the effect of weights and other parameters on the output.
To see the detailed result, please go through the attached report.
